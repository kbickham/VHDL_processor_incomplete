# VHDL_processor_incomplete
VHDL project, microprocessor.  The ALU needs worked. RAM works clocked, The program counter is a little messy.
Goal is to run this on a Spartan 3 FPGA Kit

This was a group project for my VHDL EE class. I've messed around and want to get this working on my own.

Below is the major proble right now. I have a compressed folder that I believe have my original group's work. It's been a while, but I believe this image is from my version of the processor.

The instruction set can be found in this respository as well if you feel soinclined as to mess with it.
